## Build the Documentation

The following sections describe how to set up and build the Megatron Hub documentation.

Switch to the documentation source folder and generate HTML output.

```sh
cd docs/
uv run --group docs sphinx-build . _build/html
```

- The resulting HTML files are generated in a `_build/html` folder that is created under the project `docs/` folder.
- The generated python API docs are placed in `apidocs` under the `docs/` folder.

## Live Building

When writing documentation, it can be helpful to serve the documentation and have it update live while you edit.

To do so, run:

```sh
cd docs/
uv run --group docs sphinx-autobuild . _build/html --port 12345 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open a web browser and go to `http://${HOST_WHERE_SPHINX_COMMAND_RUN}:12345` to view the output.

## Documentation Version

The three files below control the version switcher. Before you attempt to publish a new version of the documentation, update these files to match the latest version numbers.

- docs/versions1.json
- docs/project.json
- docs/conf.py
